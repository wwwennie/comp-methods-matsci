# Computational Methods in Materials Science
A graduate elective course on computational methods in materials science.

Offered through the McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.

Iterations:
- Fall 2024

## Course Description
This course is an introductory survey to simulation techniques used in materials science for modeling materials phenomena. 
Materials science is about understanding and predicting how (solid-state) materials respond to various stimuli (e.g., thermal, chemical, mechanical, optical, electrical), and using that understanding to engineer better materials. 
The emphasis of this course is on developing a mathematical, algorithmic, and physical understanding for materials simulation. 
The methods covered in this course will be connected to several on-going research areas and technological applications in chemical engineering and materials science. 

By the end of this course, students will be expected to be able to:
    - Implement materials modeling methods using basic principles and concepts of scientific coding
    - Generate, analyze, and visualize simulated data
    - Interpret simulate data and explain its physical significance
    - Propose physical models for modeling complex materials phenomena, identify their assumptions and limitations, and suggest improvements to the simulation
    - Communicate (oral and written) their results to a general audience

The course will be based on Python, a popular open-source programming language in materials science. 

Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor.
